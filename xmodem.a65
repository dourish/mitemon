;;; Basic xmodem implementation (receive only)
;;; Super simplistic. So far, this (1) doesn't implement any timeouts, and
;;; (2) bascially presumes that everything goes great or all it all just
;;; konks out... it presumes blocks will keep on going up and that there
;;; will never be re-transmissions, etc. All these are reasonable
;;; assumptions over a USB serial line that's only a couple of feet long.
